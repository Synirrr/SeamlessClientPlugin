        /*  First Step. How does a player join a game?
         *  First JoinGameInternal is called with the ServersLobbyID.
         *      In this method, MySessionLoader.UnloadAndExitToMenu() is called. Ultimatley we want to prevent this as we dont want to unload the entire game. Just the basic neccessities.
         *      Then JoinLobby is called. This looks to be simply a check to see if the client gets a result from the server. If it does, it initilizes a new STATIC/Multiplayer base by:  [Static = new MyMultiplayerLobbyClient(lobby, new MySyncLayer(new MyTransportLayer(2)))));]
         *      Once this above method is done and join is done, we begin the OnJoin()
         *      
         *  On join begins by checking join result. Success downloads world and failed sends you back to menu. (May need to use this to send players to menu)
         *      Download world Requires the multiplayerbase and MyGUIScreenProgress. Which is essentially checking that the user hasnt cliecked left or closed. 
         *      
         *      	StringBuilder text = MyTexts.Get(MyCommonTexts.DialogTextJoiningWorld);
         *          MyGuiScreenProgress progress = new MyGuiScreenProgress(text, MyCommonTexts.Cancel);
         *          
         *          This just looks to be like what happens still with the little GUI popupscreen before load starts
         * 
         *          DownloadWorld also contains a method to get the serversessionstate too. We will need to check this before load. Ultimatley once everything has passed join checks Downloadworld is called. (MyMultiplayerClientBase.DownloadWorld)
         *          
         *          
         *    MyMultiplayerClientBase.DownloadWorld simply rasies a static event to the server for world request. [return MyMultiplayerServerBase.WorldRequest;]
         *          
         *          
         *          
         *          
         *    MyMultiplayerServerBase.WorldRequest (WorldRequest) This is near the start of where the magic happens. THIS IS ALL RAN SERVERSIDE
         *          Checks to see if the client has been kicked or banned to prevent world requests. Not sure we really need to worry about this.
         *          
         *          Server gets world clears non important data such as player gps. Our player gps gets added on join so we can yeet this.
         *          Also theres a sendfluch via transport layer. Might need to keep this in mind and use this for our testings
         *          Theres a CleanUpData that gets called with world and playerid/identity ID. This is probably to limit things and only send whats neccessary
         *              CLEANUPDATA shows me how to send allplayers data synced on the server.
         *          
         *          
         *          Once we have everythings we use a MS to serialize everything to byte[] and via replication layer we send world to client.
         *          
         *          
         *     BACK TO CLIENT:
         *     RecieveWorld is called and packet is deserialized and then MyJoinGameHelper.WorldReceived(...,...) is called
         *     
         *     WorldReceived does some checks for extra version mismatches and to make sure the CheckPointObjectBuilder isnt null etc.
         *     Once it passes all these checks, CheckDx11AndJoin(world, MyMutliplayerBase) is called
         *     
         *     CheckDx11AndJoin just checks if its a scenario world or not. Forget about this. We can figure that out all later. Then it runs: MySessionLoader.LoadMultiplayerSession(world, multiplayer);
         *     
         *     
         *     MySessionLoader.LoadMultiplayerSession looks to be the start of the join code. It also checks for mod mismatches. (And Downloads them). However once it passes this, MySession.LoadMultiplayer is called.
         *     
         *     
         *     
         *     
         *     
         *     
         *     
         *     MySession.LoadMultiplayer (The most important step in world loading)
         *          Creates new MySession.
         *          Does settings stuff.
         *          LoadMembersFromWorld (Loads Clients)
         *          FixSessionComponentObjectBuilders
         *          
         *          
         *          
         *          PrepareBaseSession is something we need. Looks like it does some weird stuff to init fonts, Sector Enviroment settings, Loading datacomponents from world, and re-initilizes modAPI stuff
         *          DeserializeClusters
         *          Loads planets.
         *          RegistersChat
         *
